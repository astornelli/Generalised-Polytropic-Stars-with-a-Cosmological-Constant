# Generalised Polytropic Fluid Spheres with a Cosmological Constant
This repository is for the math model used in the paper "Generalised Polytropic Fluid Spheres with a Cosmological Constant" by Dr. Anish Agashe and Alex Stornelli. 
There are five Mathematica notebooks in this repository all with titles describing what the model was used for, with comments explaining the thought process behind the code.
The notebooks were created on Mathematica 14.0 if the numerical solver is not recognizing the stored variables it is useful to ClearAll[] before running again.
